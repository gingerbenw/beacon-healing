					<h2>Animal Healing Workshops</h2>
					<p>The Charles Siddle Foundation for Animal Healing (CSFAH) offer day and weekend workshops, and courses for those interested in exploring the world of healing animals.</p>
					<p>Students can gain Certification at all three levels in ‘Equine and Domestic Animals’. The Courses in previous years ran as ‘Equine’ or ‘Domestic Animals’, but our tutors felt that there was so much valuable information and practical experiences to be gained by working with many animal species that the courses have now been combined so that our students can gain the best possible education. We positively encourage our students to work with all species of animals but will not expect students to handle animals with which they are uncomfortable.</p>

							<h3>CSFAH Introductory Attendance Course</h3>
							<p>The CSFAH Introductory Attendance Course contains four levels. It is essential to attend level 1 (The Foundation Weekend Workshop) before progressing to the Equine and Domestic Animals levels 2 – 4. The Foundation Workshop is designed to provide you with the basic knowledge required for the further three levels. It is advisable the levels are followed in their correct sequence. These levels are repeated yearly to enable you to complete the course at your own pace. To achieve the CSFAH Introductory Attendance Course Certificate, levels 1 – 4 must be attended.</p>

							<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
							<h3>CSFAH Advanced Attendance Course</h3>
							<p>The Advanced Attendance Course is repeated every two years and is open to CSFAH Members only. Membership of the CSFAH can be gained on completion of the CSFAH Introductory Attendance Course. Once you are a member you can join the Advanced Attendance Course at any level. The course comprises Advanced Levels 1-4 (for Equine, Domestic or both), an Advanced Meditation Day, and two Advanced Dowsing Days (an assessment day and a visit to Avebury). To achieve the CSFAH Advanced Attendance Course Certificate all days must be attended. (7 days in total for Equine or Domestic students, 11 days for Equine & Domestic students.)</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h3>Practitioner's Certificate</h3>
					<p>Students can work towards their Practitioners Certificate alongside the Advanced Attendance Course. To qualify as a CSFAH Practitioner the student must be a member of the CSFAH, hold a CSFAH Introductory Attendance Course Certificate and hold a CSFAH Advanced Attendance Course Certificate. They must also have completed their Probationary Practitioners Log Book over the course of at least 2 years. The information required in the Log Book includes healing records, dowsing records personal information and development, witness testimonies and several homework essays covering many topics, to ensure a sound understanding of animal healing and harmonisation work by CSFAH Practitioners. It also contains records of healing assessments and dowsing assessments by CSFAH Tutors. Once the Advanced Attendance Certificate has been achieved and the Probationary Practitioner’s Log Book has been completed, the student can apply for CSFAH Practitioner Status.</p>
